A fork from the original [ComfyUI Nodes Documentation Plugin repo](https://github.com/CavinHuang/comfyui-nodes-docs), which is a nice plugin that provides documentation for 1900+ nodes, right inside ComfyUI itself.

The goal with this one is to make an English version, since the original is in Chinese.

I'm pretty sure I'll never finish this, not even sure I'll even start it, but oh well...

- [The original's Chinese README](README_cn.md)
- [The original's English README](README_en.md)

*Both at the time of writing this, check the original repo for any updates.*
